# scalar wave equation

Modelling the scalar wave equation in the time and frequency domain - Softwarelab 2024.

Wave simulation is used in many fields of modern day engineering, such as biomedical applications or non-destructive testing. Different compuational methods are applied to modell the wave propagation. In the frame of this project the finite difference method (FCM) is sutdied first and then the finite element method (FEM) is introduced. 

The material is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the whole domain, starting out in one dimension.

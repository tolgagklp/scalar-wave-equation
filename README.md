# scalar wave equation

Modelling the scalar wave equation in the time and frequency domain - Softwarelab 2024.

Wave simulation is used in many fields of modern-day engineering, such as biomedical applications or non-destructive testing. Different computational methods are applied to model the wave propagation. In the frame of this project, the finite difference method (FCM) is studied first, and then the finite element method (FEM) is introduced. 

The material is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the whole domain, starting in one dimension. All code written for this group project and its documentation can be found in this repository.
